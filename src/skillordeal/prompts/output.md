## How to report

When you are done, write your report as a single JSON document to `/out/findings.json` with the Write tool. That file is the only thing that is collected; anything else you say is ignored. Use Edit or Write again if you need to fix it. It must be valid JSON matching this schema:

```json
{schema}
```

Put every finding in the `findings` array (an empty array if you found nothing) and keep `summary` to a few sentences. Paths are relative to the repository root. After writing the file, reply with one short line saying it is written.
